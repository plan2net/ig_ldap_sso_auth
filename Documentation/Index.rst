	:Description:
		This extension provides LDAP support for TYPO3 by delegating the
		authentication of frontend and/or backend users to the centrally-managed
		directory of your organization. It fully supports OpenLDAP and Active
		Directory and is capable of connecting securely to the authentication
		server using either TLS or SSL (ldaps://).

		In case of use in an intranet environment, this extension is a perfect
		match since it natively brings Single Sign-On (SSO) capability to TYPO3
		without any complex configuration.
